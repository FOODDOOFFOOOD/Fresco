			<h1>About Our Leaders expirence</h1>
			<p>
As leader I have tried to accommodate my members, along with my loyal co-leads, we typically have the pass and supply donations to all members 
for war and just in general. We have had the clan for a few years now and are currently in repair. With the help of the readers and new followers
we hope to introduce a new expirence to this clan. We hope you will accompany us as we journey through this together.
All members are expected to turn off the war indicators if they are not ready to attack in war.

</p><p>
If you cannot attack in war because you are not ready, that is completely fine but we do expect effort everywhere else.
I know some things are hard to manage just make sure you do your best.
We have a rule that if you haven't been on in a while you will be removed until we have room to take you back into the clan.
If you have ANY type of struggle's attacking feel free to ask me and I can guide your effort.
